# New Identity Card Appointment System
At the beginning, we should design appointment system for new identity card . We have two different list
which are these in the following:
 
 -Citizen with Appointment 
  
 -Citizen with no Appointment

So we need divide the list depending on HasApp-->True or false
I am parsing and divide the file with the respect to"/t" tab. I obtain Citizen of idNO's Name's, Surname's
etc. containing with stl vector.

I could design with Time.h and Citizen.h.  because it becomes suitable for arrangement. Hereby, ı could compare wtih
Time.h and contain in this attributes in Citizen.h. Througly, ı could use these object in CivilRegistry.h
decision class. I use stl,operator overloading and OOP properties with this code. With this code, I serve a ordered list respect to appointment or without appointment fairly.
