# New_Card_Appointmet_System
At the beginning, we should design appointment system for new identity card . We have two different list
which are these in the following:
-Citizen with Appointment 
-Citizen with no Appointment
So we need divide the list depending on HasApp-->True or false
I am parsing and divide the file with the respect to"/t" tab. I obtain Citizen of idNO's Name's, Surname's
etc. containing with stl vector.

I coul design Time.h and Citizen.h.  because it becomes suitable for arrangement. Hereby, ı could compare wtih
Time.h and containing in this Attributes in Citizen.h. Througly, ı could use this object in CivilRegistry
decision class. I use stl,operator overloading and OOP properties with this code.
