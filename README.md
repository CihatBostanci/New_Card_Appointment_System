# New_Card_Appointmet_System
NEW_CARD_APPOINTMENT_SYSTEM
In this code is about appointment system. Definetely, you could understand there are two type of list which are woutapp and wapp(Citizen with appointment and
Citizen without appointment). And then we have appointment.txt. In the beginning, I divide by suitable type "in the beginning of main part"
After that, This code is becoming meaningful with Time,Citizen and CivilRegistry classes. I have to compare time and have a appointment or not. Respect to
these information Ä± built my code using Stl and operator overloading. And give ordered output via Name's.
